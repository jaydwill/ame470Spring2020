# Assignment 2
`Due Jan 31, before midnight`

## Task

Please complete the tutorial for `ajaxEg`.

The code is identical to the `evalServer` discussed in last class.

Your tutorial needs to have the following steps

1. Server started using `node`
2. Client (`index.html`) loaded.
3. User enters equation into `<textarea>`; clicks on `Calculate`.
4. Client sends asynchronous request (`/eval`)
5. Server responds with the result.
6. The result is displayed client-side.



Please use screenshots/images (or make a youtube video!) explaining the sequence
of events when the code executes on the client and server.
